To configure your application with [Application Single Sign-On for VMware Tanzu](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Platform/1.2/tap/GUID-app-sso-about.html) using Okta as authentication provider, have a look at the sample files in the [app-sso folder](app-sso) and the [documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/Application-Single-Sign-On-for-VMware-Tanzu/1.0/appsso/GUID-service-operators-identity-providers.html#openid-connect-providers).
